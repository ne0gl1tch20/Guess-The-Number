## üß∞ 9. Recovery Tool Guide (`recovery.py`)

The **Guess The Number** game stores important data like your stats and achievements locally. If a power outage or a system crash corrupts these files, the main game might fail to start. This is where **`recovery.py`** saves the day!

### How to Use the Recovery Tool:

1.  Make sure the main game (**`main.py`** or **`.exe`**) is *not* running.
2.  Open your terminal/command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory containing **`recovery.py`**.
4.  Run the script:

    ```bash
    python recovery.py
    ```

5.  The tool will automatically:
    * **Scan** all save files for errors (invalid JSON, missing keys, etc.).
    * If no errors are found, it will safely exit.
    * If errors **are** found, it will present a dialog with the option to **Reset All Save Data**.

> üö® **WARNING:** Selecting **Reset All Save Data** will wipe your statistics, achievements, and leaderboard scores, restoring the files to their factory defaults. Only use this if the main game won't launch!

## üí° 13. Extra Tips and Notes for Players

* **Binary Search is Your Friend:** The fastest way to guess a number in a range is to always guess the middle number. This method (called a binary search) guarantees the win in the minimum number of moves!

* **Backup Your Saves:** If you are paranoid about losing your amazing stats, periodically make a copy of the **`GuessTheNumber`** folder mentioned in Section 10!
* **Report Bugs:** Found an issue? Report it to **respitory** so we can make the game even better!
